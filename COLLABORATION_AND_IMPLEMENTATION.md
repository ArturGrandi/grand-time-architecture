# Collaboration and Implementation Framework  
*(Grand Time)*

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the principles of collaboration with engineers,
researchers, and system architects participating in the implementation
of the **Grand Time** architecture.

This document is NOT:
- an investment offer,
- an employment offer,
- a commercial contract,
- a promise of financial compensation.

Its sole purpose is to establish an **architectural framework for participation**
and contribution accounting within the Grand Time system.

---

## 2. Project Context

Grand Time is a macroeconomic architecture in which:

- human time is treated as a fundamental category of value,
- the system exists **in parallel to the financial system**, not as a replacement,
- architecture, formulas, and invariants take priority over token mechanics.

Current project status:
- Architecture 1.0,
- research and specification phase,
- prior art publicly established,
- no production deployment is performed.

---

## 3. Who We Invite to Collaborate

We are open to collaboration and discussion with:

- senior blockchain and protocol engineers,
- security engineers and auditors,
- system and infrastructure architects,
- researchers in economic systems and formal verification.

We are particularly interested in individuals who value:
- long-horizon economic systems,
- protocol-level constraints and invariants,
- non-financial models of value,
- architectural thinking measured in decades, not releases.

---

## 4. Principle of Participation

Participation in Grand Time is treated as an **architectural and technical contribution**,
not as work performed for payment or equity.

Forms of contribution may include:
- implementation of smart contracts according to published specifications,
- development of interfaces and tooling,
- testing, formal verification, and security review,
- research of alternative implementations of the architecture.

Each contribution is:
- technically verifiable,
- evaluated against published specifications,
- recorded as part of the architectural history of the system.

## 5. GUCT and Contribution Accounting

**GUCT is not a token by nature.**  
It is not a currency, a security, or a financial instrument.

GUCT represents a unit for accounting **human time and contribution**
within the Grand Time system.

Technical standards (such as ERC-20 or others) may be used
**strictly as implementation interfaces** and do not define
the economic meaning of GUCT.

The economic meaning of GUCT is defined exclusively by:
- the Grand Time architecture,
- formal formulas,
- explicitly stated non-goals.

---

## 6. Allocation Cap and Scope of Implementation

For the complete implementation of the Grand Time architecture
(smart contracts, interfaces, tests, and demonstration components),
a **finite architectural contribution cap** expressed in GUCT is defined.

This cap:
- is limited and finite,
- is not a price,
- is not a monetary valuation,
- does not imply market value.

It serves solely as an **internal measure of the scale of human participation**
required to demonstrate the operational viability of the model.

---

## 7. Absence of Vesting and Market Mechanisms

Within the Grand Time system:
- no vesting mechanisms exist,
- no token sales or liquidity mechanisms exist,
- no market pricing or yield incentives exist.

This is intentional.

Contribution accounting does **not automatically convert**
into economic, financial, or ownership rights.

---

## 8. Governance and Decision-Making

Technical and organizational decisions related to implementation
are executed within the framework of:

- the Grand Time architecture,
- DAO Grand Time Fund,
- a multisignature coordination model without voting or token governance.

Decisions are **executive and architectural in nature**,
not political, economic, or speculative.

---

## 9. What This Document Does NOT Mean

This document does NOT represent:
- an invitation to invest,
- a promise of income or future value,
- a guarantee of compensation,
- an automatic reward mechanism,
- a legal obligation between parties.

It defines a **conceptual framework for collaboration**
for individuals aligned with the architectural intent of Grand Time.

## 10. Status

Active  
(Architecture and Specification Phase)

This document is published as part of the Grand Time architectural archive
to establish clarity, boundaries, and correct expectations for collaboration.
