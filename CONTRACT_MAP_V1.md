# Contract Map v1

## Status
Reference mapping — non-production, implementation guidance only.

## Purpose
This document maps GT 1.0 architectural and economic invariants
to required on-chain contract roles and responsibilities.

No implementation code is included.

---

## Mapping Principles

- Architecture defines meaning.
- Formulas define constraints.
- Contracts enforce invariants.
- Interfaces do not define economics.

## Core Contract Roles (Overview)

(To be defined)

## Relationship to Other Documents

- ARCHITECTURE_1_0.md — canonical system meaning
- FORMULAS.md — formal invariants and equations
- GT1 Formular Standard — implementation reference
