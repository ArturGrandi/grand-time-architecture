# DAO Grand Time Fund

## 1. Purpose and Scope

DAO Grand Time Fund is an internal coordination and execution structure
designed to support the development, maintenance, and continuity of the
Grand Time system.

The DAO exists solely to enable implementation of architectural,
research, and technical components defined within the Grand Time framework.

This document defines the architectural role of the DAO.
It does not define financial, investment, or commercial activities.

---

## 2. Non-Commercial and Non-Investment Nature

DAO Grand Time Fund is not an investment fund.

It does not:
- accept external investments,
- issue investment instruments,
- promise or distribute financial returns,
- operate as a profit-seeking entity.

All activities of the DAO are constrained by the non-commercial
and research-oriented goals of the Grand Time project.

---

## 3. Governance Model

DAO Grand Time Fund operates under a multisignature control model.

Key properties:
- multisig with 10 independent signers,
- no token-based governance,
- no voting mechanisms,
- no delegation or representation layers.

Decisions are operational and execution-focused,
not political or speculative.

## 4. Relationship to Grand Time Architecture

The DAO is a supporting structure of the Grand Time Architecture,
as defined in ARCHITECTURE_1_0.md.

The architecture defines:
- economic meaning,
- system boundaries,
- temporal logic,
- non-goals.

The DAO does not redefine or extend architectural assumptions.
It exists to implement and maintain them.

## 5. Relationship to GUCT

GUCT is not a token by nature.

ERC-20 or other technical standards may be used solely as
implementation interfaces.

The economic meaning of GUCT is defined by:
- the Grand Time architecture,
- formal formulas,
- explicit non-goals.

It is not defined by token standards, interfaces, or market conventions.

GUCT represents capital of human time,
not a currency, security, or financial instrument.

## 6. Relationship to GT 1.0 Formular Standard

The DAO may support implementation of protocol standards,
including GT 1.0 Formular Standard.

However:
- standards define rules,
- the DAO executes implementation,
- neither defines investment properties.

No production deployment is implied by this document.

---

## 7. Explicit Non-Goals

DAO Grand Time Fund explicitly does not:
- act as an investment DAO,
- conduct fundraising,
- issue securities or tokens by intent,
- provide yield, dividends, or profit mechanisms,
- replace legal or institutional governance systems.
