# Grand Time Architecture — Freeze Notice

## Status

This repository represents a frozen architectural and formal specification
of the Grand Time system.

All core economic, temporal, and security invariants are finalized.

## Scope Lock

The following elements are considered fixed and non-negotiable:

- Human time as an independent unit of economic meaning
- GUCT as capital of human time (non-currency, non-security)
- CR / SR invariants
- 333-day stability standard
- Mint coverage gates and Time Capital redirection
- Oracle behavior and failure handling
- Multi-asset liquidity and emergency segregation
- Non-commercial, non-investment nature of the system

## Contribution Policy

Contributions are accepted only for:

- implementation accuracy,
- formal verification,
- simulation and testing approaches,
- documentation clarity.

Proposals that alter economic meaning, introduce tokenomics,
or redefine system intent will not be accepted.

## Prior Art Declaration

This repository is published to establish authorship,
chronological origin, and architectural intent.

It is not a production system and does not constitute
an offer of any financial instrument.
