# Grand Time Architecture

This repository contains the original conceptual architecture of **Grand Time** —
a macroeconomic time-based valuation system designed as an alternative framework
for measuring human economic contribution beyond fiat currency models.
## Start Here

Research-only: no production deployment, no operational guarantees, no commercial use.

- ARCHITECTURE_1_0.md — canonical system architecture
- FORMULAS.md — formal economic and temporal model
- DAO_GRAND_TIME_FUND.md — non-commercial execution structure
- COLLABORATION_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md — open research and implementation questions

This publication is intended to establish:
- authorship,
- prior art,
- chronological origin of the Grand Time model.

No executable code is included at this stage.
## For Researchers and Senior Developers

This repository intentionally contains no executable code.

Grand Time is published as prior art and an architectural framework.
We are interested in collaboration with senior engineers, researchers,
and system architects who enjoy working on:

- macroeconomic system design,
- non-financial value models,
- protocol-level constraints and invariants,
- long-horizon economic systems.

If you are interested in exploring implementation approaches,
formal verification, or alternative representations of this architecture,
you are welcome to open an issue or start a discussion.
